# Fine-Tuning a Russian Token Classification Model for Discourse Markers

## Project Overview

This project focuses on fine-tuning a Russian language model from Hugging Face for token classification, specifically for identifying discourse markers. Discourse markers are words or phrases that help structure text, indicating relationships between sentences or clauses (e.g., "however," "therefore," "in other words").

## Model Information

We use a pretrained Russian model from Hugging Face that is specialized in token classification. The fine-tuning process adapts this model to accurately detect and classify discourse markers in Russian text.
