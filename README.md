# Fine-Tuning a Russian Token Classification Model for Discourse Markers

## Project Overview

This project focuses on fine-tuning a Russian language model for token classification, specifically for identifying discourse markers. 
Discourse markers are words or phrases that help structure text, indicating relationships between sentences or clauses (e.g., "however," "therefore," "in other words").

## Model Information
We use a pretrained Russian model from Hugging Face that is specialized in token classification.
The fine-tuning process adapts this model to accurately detect and classify discourse markers in Russian text.
